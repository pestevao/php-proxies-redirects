# php-proxies-redirects

**The simplest proxy and/or redirect engine made with php**

Initial statement: I'm not a programer. I'm a Systems Engenieer.

Some point in time, I have been asked for help with some proxy and/or redirect engine without the ability to install any apps.

By the time I only had access php and apache to do so and aditionally access to cron and to and existing lsyncd (and rsync) installation.

I made the decision to share this, maybe it is useful to someone else too and / or easly adapted to some other use cases.

So that's it: maybe a awfull code but a working one.
